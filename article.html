                <h2>NASA is trying to squash conspiracy theories about zhe space station leak</h2>
                <p>
                    Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure leak occurred on the International Space Station, and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, are now trying to quell the rumors.

                    In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space agency is working closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. The statement also notes that no information will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, despite rampant speculation in the Russian press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.
                    
                    During a teleconference yesterday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and Roscosmos general director Dmitry Rogozin “affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation,” according to the statement. “They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.”

                <h2>EU approves controversal Copyright Directive, including internet 'link tax'</h2>
                <p>
                    The directive was originally rejected by MEPs in July following criticism of two key provisions: Articles 11 and 13, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter” by critics. However, in parliament this morning, an updated version of the directive was approved, along with amended versions of Articles 11 and 13. The final vote was 438 in favor and 226 against.
                    "The fight is far from finished"
                    
                    The fallout from this decision will be far-reaching, and take a long time to settle. The directive itself still faces a final vote in January 2019 (although experts say it’s unlikely it will be rejected). After that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the directive’s text.
                    
                    The most important parts of this are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 is intended to give publishers and papers a way to make money when companies like Google link to their stories, allowing them to demand paid licenses. Article 13 requires certain platforms like YouTube and Facebook stop users sharing unlicensed copyrighted material.

                <h2>Jeff Bezos is going to create schools where 'the child is the customer'</h2>
                <p>
                    A year after asking for suggestions on philanthropy, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is unveiling his first projects. The highlight will be the creation of a network for nonprofit preschools that are to be built in low-income communities and accept students at no charge.

                    Bezos also intends to fund existing nonprofits that help homeless families by providing access to housing and food. Both initiatives will be overseen by something he’s calling the Bezos Day One Fund, which he’s committing $2 billion toward.
                    
                    Each of the initiatives will have a specific group behind it: the Day 1 Families Fund and the Day 1 Academies Fund. The Families Fund will issue grants on a yearly basis to organizations doing “needle-moving work.” The Academies Fund will be in charge of launching and operating a network of schools entirely on its own. Bezos says they’ll be “high-quality” Montessori-inspired schools that offer “full scholarship,” seemingly to all students.
                    Bezos says he wants to directly control the schools’ operation so that they can be run like Amazon and adopt Amazon’s principles. “Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession,” he writes. “The child will be the customer.”

                    The initiative was announced in a note posted on Twitter. In the note, Bezos didn’t say how far along any of this was or when either initiative would get started. “Day One” is supposed to be a phrase about staying in a startup mindset, but it also seems like it may literally be day one for these ventures.

                <h2>Polar's mew fitness watch will measure the wattage of your exercise</h2>
                <p>
                    Polar announced two new workout trackers today: the more expensive Vantage V and the cheaper Vantage M companion. Let’s start with the bigger, more expensive watch. The Vantage V costs $499.90 and includes a new optical heart rate sensor with nine LEDs along two different wavelengths (green and red). This, the company says, should make its heart rate readings more accurate.

                    The biggest addition to the watch is its power measurements for running. This is a relatively new metric, but you might recognize it because of products like Stryd. It essentially measures a wearer’s work output, similar to how cyclists measure their watts generated. Runners likely will appreciate this for training purposes. It doesn’t support LTE, although it does have a built-in GPS. It charges over a custom charger and should last for 40 hours of sports activity time, Polar says. It’s also water and swim-proof. The watch features a 1.2-inch, 240 x 240 touchscreen that’ll turn off once wearers enter their workout mode. It’s available in white, black, and orange.
                    
                    The cheaper Vantage M costs $279.90 and features a lot of the same technology, except for the touchscreen and running power detection. Unlike on the Vantage V, you can actually change the bands on the Vantage M. The watch also doesn’t include one of Polar’s signature software features, “recovery mode,” which analyzes wearers’ previous workouts to determine how long they’ll need to recover. Both watches are available for preorder today through Polar’s website and will ship in October.
