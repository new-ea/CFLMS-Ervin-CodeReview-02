                <h2>NASA is trying to squash conspiracy theories about zhe space station leak</h2>
                <p>
                    Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure leak occurred on the International Space Station, and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, are now trying to quell the rumors.

                    In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space agency is working closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. The statement also notes that no information will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, despite rampant speculation in the Russian press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.
                    
                    During a teleconference yesterday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and Roscosmos general director Dmitry Rogozin “affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation,” according to the statement. “They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.”

                <h2>EU approves controversal Copyright Directive, including internet 'link tax'</h2>
                <p>
                    The directive was originally rejected by MEPs in July following criticism of two key provisions: Articles 11 and 13, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter” by critics. However, in parliament this morning, an updated version of the directive was approved, along with amended versions of Articles 11 and 13. The final vote was 438 in favor and 226 against.
                    "The fight is far from finished"
                    
                    The fallout from this decision will be far-reaching, and take a long time to settle. The directive itself still faces a final vote in January 2019 (although experts say it’s unlikely it will be rejected). After that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the directive’s text.
                    
                    The most important parts of this are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 is intended to give publishers and papers a way to make money when companies like Google link to their stories, allowing them to demand paid licenses. Article 13 requires certain platforms like YouTube and Facebook stop users sharing unlicensed copyrighted material.

                <h2>Jeff Bezos is going to create schools where 'the child is the customer'</h2>
                <p>
                    A year after asking for suggestions on philanthropy, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is unveiling his first projects. The highlight will be the creation of a network for nonprofit preschools that are to be built in low-income communities and accept students at no charge.

                    Bezos also intends to fund existing nonprofits that help homeless families by providing access to housing and food. Both initiatives will be overseen by something he’s calling the Bezos Day One Fund, which he’s committing $2 billion toward.
                    
                    Each of the initiatives will have a specific group behind it: the Day 1 Families Fund and the Day 1 Academies Fund. The Families Fund will issue grants on a yearly basis to organizations doing “needle-moving work.” The Academies Fund will be in charge of launching and operating a network of schools entirely on its own. Bezos says they’ll be “high-quality” Montessori-inspired schools that offer “full scholarship,” seemingly to all students.
                    Bezos says he wants to directly control the schools’ operation so that they can be run like Amazon and adopt Amazon’s principles. “Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession,” he writes. “The child will be the customer.”

                <h2>Polar's mew fitness watch will measure the wattage of your exercise</h2>
                <p>
                    Polar announced two new workout trackers today: the more expensive Vantage V and the cheaper Vantage M companion. Let’s start with the bigger, more expensive watch. The Vantage V costs $499.90 and includes a new optical heart rate sensor with nine LEDs along two different wavelengths (green and red). This, the company says, should make its heart rate readings more accurate.

                    The biggest addition to the watch is its power measurements for running. This is a relatively new metric, but you might recognize it because of products like Stryd. It essentially measures a wearer’s work output, similar to how cyclists measure their watts generated. Runners likely will appreciate this for training purposes. It doesn’t support LTE, although it does have a built-in GPS. It charges over a custom charger and should last for 40 hours of sports activity time, Polar says. It’s also water and swim-proof. The watch features a 1.2-inch, 240 x 240 touchscreen that’ll turn off once wearers enter their workout mode. It’s available in white, black, and orange.

                <h2>Elon Musk smokes marijuana live on web show</h2>
                <p>
                    Tesla shares crashed 6% on Friday as two of its senior executives quit, just hours after the electric carmaker’s chief executive Elon Musk sparked concern by smoking marijuana on a live web show.

                    The company’s head of accounting, Dave Morton, and head of human resources, Gaby Toledano, said they were leaving the company, which has been placed at the centre of a string of controversies by its maverick CEO.
                    
                    Morton, who joined the company just one month ago, said he was leaving because “the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations”.
                    
                    “This caused me to reconsider my future. I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting.”

                    Morton joined the company one day before Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private with “funding secured”. The plan was abandoned 17 days later, but not after drawing a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a series of lawsuits alleging market manipulation.

                <h2>Edward Snowden surveillance powers ruled unlawful</h2>
                <p>
                    The UK's bulk interception powers, exposed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have been found to be illegal by the European Court of Human Rights.

                    In a landmark judgement, the court ruled agencies had violated rights as there were no proper safeguards.
                    
                    The court crucially said bulk interception was legitimate and it had seen no evidence it had been abused.
                    
                    Parliament reformed surveillance powers in 2016 and introduced a new watchdog. Critics say the system is still flawed.
                    
                    What were the powers being challenged in court?
                    In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ - the UK's eavesdropping agency - had been secretly collecting communications sent over the internet on an industrial scale.
                    
                    It could reassemble the communications, filter them and then analyse the remainder for anything useful to protecting national security.
                    
                    Bulk surveillance programmes revealed:
                    
                    "Tempora" - the bulk storage of all internet traffic GCHQ could harvest
                    "Karma Police" - an attempt to catalogue the web habits of any user who could be found

                <p>
                    The long wait for the more affordable iPhone XR is nearly over. Following its mid-September announcement alongside the flagship iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, preorders for the $749 XR begin on Friday, October 19th, and the phone will be available the following Friday, October 26th.

                    Preordering is necessary if you want to receive your new iPhone on launch day. Those who opt out of preordering may be lucky enough to find a new model at a local carrier retail store shortly after launch, though it’s more likely that you may be without one for as long as a few days or weeks.

                    If you’re set on preordering, get your iPhone ready to trade in, and be prepared to stay up late — no matter where you are in the US.

                    APPLE
                    Boot up the Apple Store app on your iPhone this Friday, October 19th at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET to be among the first to place your order.

                    If you have an iPhone X, you can get up to $525 in credit toward your purchase through Apple’s GiveBack trade-in program. Even trading in an iPhone 7 can knock $200 off of your final purchase price.

                <h2>Spotify raises limit for offline downloads to 10,000 songs per device</h2>
                <p>
                    Spotify is improving of one of its most annoying, arbitrary limits. The music streaming app has increased the cap for maximum number of offline downloads, which was previously stuck at 3,333 songs per device (on a maximum of three devices).

                    As reported by Rolling Stone, that limit has now been raised to 10,000 songs — and you can download that many tunes on five different devices instead of just three. So you’re looking at 50,000 in all. “At Spotify, we’re always working on improving the experience for our users,” a company spokesperson told Rolling Stone.

                    Unfortunately, Spotify’s other annoying ceiling — a 10,000 track limit on your personal library — remains very much in place. That’s really the one I keep running into. Once you hit it, you’ve constantly got to pluck out albums or artists you’re not listening to regularly. Hopefully the bump up in offline downloads is a sign that Spotify might soon also raise the maximum library size, as well. I can save 50,000 songs to a handful of devices, but I’m unable to have those same songs in my library? Doesn’t make a ton of sense. Please fix.
